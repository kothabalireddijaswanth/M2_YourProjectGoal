Report : the purpose of this project is to develop an independent security system that able recognize human with activate system alarm that possess linkage CCTV and buzzer at home during lack the owner. This requirement has become a demanded as nowadays system are too dependent to the community. Although the system is in ‘on’ condition, some communities are not alert to this situation. Different with an ordinary system, this  project will be able to inform visitor or thief with signal alarm and buzzer when an unwanted visitor enters the range of the sensor. Even though this system is based on range, it has been modified to detect only human body. So there is no possibility that system will be triggered ‘on’ by an animal. If the system has been triggered, it will record photo visitor or thief with CCTV for owner come to know at home during lack owner. The main objective of this project is to develop a security system for trace  presence visitor and thief with using sensor and buzzer. Therefore, this system will be independent and a reliable device compared to common system.
